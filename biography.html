			<h2>Racing career</h2>
			<br/>
			<p>In 1920, Ferrari joined the racing department of Alfa Romeo as a driver. Ferrari won his first Grand Prix in 1923 in Ravenna on the Savio Circuit. 
			1924 was his best season, with three wins, including Ravenna, Polesine and the Coppa Acerbo in Pescara. Deeply shocked by the death of Ugo Sivocci in 1923 and Antonio Ascari in 1925,
			Ferrari, by his own admissions, continued to race half-heartedly. At the same time, he developed a taste for the organizational aspects of Grand Prix racing.
			Following the birth of his son Alfredo (Dino) in 1932, Ferrari decided to retire and to focus instead on the management and development of the factory Alfa race cars,
			eventually building up a raceteam of superstar drivers, including Giuseppe Campari and Tazio Nuvolari. This team was called Scuderia Ferrari (founded by Enzo in 1929)
			and acted as a racing division for Alfa Romeo. The team was very successful, thanks to the excellent cars, for example the Alfa Romeo P3 and to the talented drivers, like Nuvolari.
			Ferrari retired from competitive driving having participated in 41 Grands Prix with a record of 11 wins.
			In this period the prancing horse emblem began to show up on his team's cars. The emblem had been created and sported by Italian fighter plane pilot Francesco Baracca.
			During World War I, Baracca gave Ferrari a necklace with the prancing horse on it prior to takeoff. Baracca was shot down and killed by an Austrian aeroplane in 1918.
			In memory of his death, Ferrari used the prancing horse to create the emblem that would become the world-famous Ferrari shield. Initially displayed on Alfa Romeos, 
			the shield was first seen on a Ferrari in 1947.</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Building Ferrari</h2>
			<br/>
			<p>Alfa Romeo agreed to partner Ferrari's racing team until 1933,
			when financial constraints forced them to withdraw their support – a decision subsequently
			retracted thanks to the intervention of Pirelli. Despite the quality of the Scuderia drivers,
			the team struggled to compete with Auto Union and Mercedes. 
			Although the German manufacturers dominated the era, Ferrari's team achieved a notable victory
			in 1935 when Tazio Nuvolari beat Rudolf Caracciola and Bernd Rosemeyer on their home turf
			at the German Grand Prix.</p>
			<p>In 1937 Scuderia Ferrari was dissolved and Ferrari returned to Alfa's racing team,
			named Alfa Corse. Alfa Romeo decided to regain full control of its racing division,
			retaining Ferrari as Sporting Director.
			After a disagreement with Alfa's managing director Ugo Gobbato,
			Ferrari left in 1939 and founded Auto-Avio Costruzioni, a company supplying parts
			to other racing teams. Although a contract clause restricted him from racing or designing cars
			for four years, Ferrari managed to manufacture two cars for the 1940 Mille Miglia, 
			which were driven by Alberto Ascari and Lotario Rangoni. With the outbreak of World War II,
			Ferrari's factory was forced to undertake war production for Mussolini's fascist government.
			Following Allied bombing of the factory, Ferrari relocated from Modena to Maranello.
			At the end of the war, Ferrari decided to start making cars bearing his name, and founded Ferrari
			S.p.A. in 1947.</p>
			<p>Ferrari's decision to continue racing in the Mille Miglia brought the company new
			victories and greatly increased public recognition. However, increasing speeds, poor roads,
			and nonexistent crowd protection eventually spelled disaster for both the race and Ferrari.
			During the 1957 Mille Miglia, near the town of Guidizzolo, a 4.0-litre Ferrari 335 S driven
			by Alfonso de Portago was traveling at 250 km/h when it blew a tyre and crashed into the roadside
			crowd, killing de Portago, his co-driver and nine spectators, five of whom were children. 
			In response, Enzo Ferrari and Englebert, the tyre manufacturer, were charged with manslaughter 
			in a lengthy criminal prosecution that was finally dismissed in 1961.</p>
			<p>Many of Ferrari's greatest victories came at Le Mans 
			(nine victories, including six in a row in 1960–1965) and in
			Formula One during the 1950s and 1960s, with the successes of Juan Manuel Fangio (1956),
			Mike Hawthorn (1958), and Phil Hill (1961).</p><br/>
			<h2>Personal life</h2><br/>
			<p>Enzo Ferrari spent a reserved life, and rarely granted interviews.
			He seldom left Modena and Maranello and never went to any Grands Prix outside of Italy 
			after the 1950s. He was usually seen at the Grands Prix at Monza near Milan and/or Imola,
			not far from the Ferrari factory, and named after the late Dino. His last known trip abroad
			was in 1982 when he went to Paris to broker a compromise between the warring FISA and FOCA parties.
			He never flew in an aeroplane and never set foot in a lift.</p>
			<p>He married Laura Dominica Garello on 28 April 1923, 
			and they remained married until her death. They had one son, Alfredo "Dino",
			who was born in 1932 and groomed as Enzo's successor,
			but he suffered from ill-health and died from muscular dystrophy in 1956.
			Enzo had a second son, Piero, with his mistress Lina Lardi in 1945.
			As divorce was illegal in Italy until 1975, Piero could only be recognized as Enzo's son
			after Laura's death in 1978. Piero is currently the vice chairman of the Ferrari 
			company with a 10% share ownership.</p>
			<p>Ferrari died on 14 August 1988 in Maranello at the age of 90. 
			No cause of death was given. His death was not made public until two days later,
			as by Enzo's request, to compensate for the late registration of his birth.
			He witnessed the launch of the Ferrari F40, shortly before his death, which was dedicated
			as a symbol of his achievements. In 2002 the first car to be named after him was
			launched as the Enzo Ferrari.</p>
